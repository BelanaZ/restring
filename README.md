# restring
Functional enrichment terms aggregator

```restring``` is designed to aggregate functional enrichment data, preferably from String-compliant table delimited text (```.tdt```) tables. ```restring``` is currently under **active** development, including this doc, and it's still **not ready for use**.

doc: coming soon

examples: coming soon

## Overview
```restring``` aggregates functional enrichment data from the table separated values (```.tsv```) tables produced by [String](https://string-db.org/). It returns, in table-friendly format, aggregated results from analyses of multiple comparisons.

What KEGG pathway was found in which comparisons? What pvalues? What DE genes annotated in that pathway were shared in those comparisons? How can I simultaneously show results for all my experimental groups, for all terms, all at once? This can all be managed by ```restring```.

---

Modern high-throughput -omic approaches generate huge lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes/proteins, which can in turn be used for functional enrichment studies. Manualy reviewing a large number of such analyses is time consuming, especially for experimental designs with more than a few groups. Let's consider this experimental setup:

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/Figure%201.jpg)

This represents a fairly common experimental design, but manually inspecting functional enrichment results for such all possible combinations would require substantial effort. Let's take a look at how we can tackle this issue with ```restring```.

Our sample experimental setup has **two treatments**, given at **two time points** to **three different sample types**. Let's assume those samples are cells of different genotypes, and we'd like to mainly investigate genotype comparisons. After quantifying gene expression by RNAseq, we have DE genes for every comparison. As in many experimental pipelines, each list of DE genes is investigated with functional enrichment tools, such as [String](https://string-db.org/). But every comparison generates one or more tables. ```restring``` makes it easy to generate summary reports from all of them, automatically.

## Procedure
### 1. Prepping the files

Head over to [String](https://string-db.org/), and analyze your gene/protein list. Please refer to the [String documentation](https://string-db.org/cgi/help) for help. After running the analysis, hit the ![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/analysis.png) button at the bottom of the page. This allows to download the results as tab delimited text files.

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/export_supported.png)

```restring``` is designed to work with the results types highlighted in green. For each one of your experimental settings, create a folder with a name that will serve as a label for it. Here's how our [sample data](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/tree/main/sample_data) is arranged:

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/files.png)

Not all comparisons resulted in a DE gene list that long enough to generate functional enrichment results (see image above), thus a few comparisons _(folders)_ are missing. When the DE gene list was sufficiently long to generate results for all analyses, this is what the folder content looks like _(example of one folder)_:

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/folder%20content.png)

For each enrichment (```KEGG```, ```Component```, ```Function```, ```Process``` and ```RCTM```), we fed String with DE genes that were either up- or downregulated with respect of one of the genotypes of the analysis. ```restring``` **makes use** of the ```UP``` and ```DOWN``` labels in the filenames to know what direction the analysis went _(it's possible to aggregate_ ```UP``` _and_ ```DOWN``` _DE genes together)_.

It's OK to have folders that don't contain all files (if there were insufficient DE genes to produce some), like in the folder ```ctrl_t1_KO_vs_DKO```:

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/missing%20analyses%20folder.png)

### 2. Aggregating the results

Once everything is set up, we can run ```restring``` to aggregate info from all the sparse results. The following example makes use of the String results that can be found in [sample data](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/tree/main/sample_data).

```python
import restring

dirs = restring.get_dirs()
print(dirs)
```

```python
['ctrl_t0_wt_vs_DKO', 'ctrl_t0_wt_vs_KO', 'ctrl_t1_KO_vs_DKO', 'ctrl_t1_wt_vs_DKO', 'ctrl_t1_wt_vs_KO', 'treatment_t0_wt_vs_DKO', 'treatment_t0_wt_vs_KO', 'treatment_t1_KO_vs_DKO', 'treatment_t1_wt_vs_DKO', 'treatment_t1_wt_vs_KO']
```

```get_dirs()``` returns a ```list``` of all folders within the current directory, to the excepion of folders beginning with ```__``` or ```.```. We can start aggregating results with default parameters (```KEGG``` pathways for both ```UP``` and ```DOWN``` regulated genes).

```python
db = restring.aggregate_results(dirs)
```

```python
Start walking the directory structure.

Running ```aggregate_results()``` with other parameters is possible:

```python
help(restring.aggregate_results)
```

```
# truncated output
    Walks the given <directories> list, and reads the String .tsv files of
    defined <kind>.
    
    Params:
    =======
    directories: <list> of directories where to look for String files
    
    kind:    <str> Defines the String filetype to process. Kinds defined in
             settings.file_types
    
    directions: <list> contaning the up- or down-regulated genes in a comparison.
             Info is retrieved from either UP and/or DOWN lists.
             * Prerequisite *: generating files form String with UP and/or DOWN regulated
             genes separately.
    
    verbose: <bool>; turns verbose mode on or off
```

The ```kind```Â parameter is picked from the 5 supported String result tables:

```python
print(restring.settings.file_types)
```

```python
('Component', 'Function', 'KEGG', 'Process', 'RCTM')
```

To manipulate the aggregated results, it's convenient to put them into a table:

```
df = restring.tableize_aggregated(db)
```

This functions wraps the results into a handy ```pandas.DataFrame``` object, that can be saved as a table for further inspection:

```
df.to_csv("results.csv")
```

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/Figure%203.png)

The table contains all terms cumulatively retrieved from all comparisons _(directories/columns)_. For every term, common genes (if any) are listed. These common genes only include comparisons where the term actually shows up. If the term just appears in exactly one comparison, this is explicitly stated: ```n/a (just one condition)```. P-values are the ones retrieved from the String tables _(the lower, the better)_. Missing p-values are represented with ```1``` (this can be set to anything ```str()``` accepts when calling ```tableize_aggregated()``` with the ```not_found``` parameter).

These 'aggregated' tables are useful for charting the results (see later). There's other info that can be extracted form aggregated results, in the form of a 'summary' table:

```python
res = restring.summary(db)
res.to_csv("summary.csv")
```

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/Figure%204.png)

These can be useful to find the most interesting terms across all comparisons: better p-value, presence in most/selected comparisons), as well as finding the most recurring DE genes for each term.

### 3. Visualizing the results
'aggregated'-type tables can be readily transformed into beautiful clustermaps. This is simply done by passing either the ```df``` object previolsly created with ```tableize_aggregated()```, or the file name of the table that was saved from that object to the ```draw_clustermap()``` function:

```python
clus = restring.draw_clustermap("results.csv")
```

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/clus_1.png)

_(The output may vary depending on your version of plotting libraries)_ Note that ```draw_clustermap()``` actually _returns_ the ```seaborn.matrix.ClusterGrid``` object that it generates internally, this might come handy to retrieve the reordered (clustered) elements (more on that later).

The drawing function is basically a wrapper for [```seaborn.clustermap()```](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html), of which retains all the flexible customization options, but allows for an immediate tweaking of the picture. For instance, we might just want to plot the highest-ranking terms and have all of them clearly written on a readable heatmap:

```python
clus = restring.draw_clustermap("results.csv", pval_min=6, readable=True)
```

![](https://github.com/Stemanz/restring/raw/main/images/clus_2.png)

More tweaking is possibile:

```python
help(restring.draw_clustermap)
```

```python
Help on function draw_clustermap in module restring.restring:

draw_clustermap(data, figsize=None, sort_values=None, log_transform=True, log_base=10, log_na=0, pval_min=None, custom_index=None, custom_cols=None, unwanted_terms=None, title=None, title_size=24, savefig=False, outfile_name='aggregated results.png', dpi=300, readable=False, **kwargs)
    Draws a clustermap of an 'aggregated'-type table.
    
    This functions expects this table layout (example):
    
    terms â exp. cond 1 | exp. cond 2 | exp cond n ..
    âââââââ¼ââââââââââââââ¼ââââââââââââââ¼ââââââââââââ..
    term 1â     0.01    |      1      |  0.00023
    ------â¼-------------â¼-------------â¼------------..
    term 2â      1      |    0.05     |     1    
    ------â¼-------------â¼-------------â¼------------..
      ..  â     ..      |      ..     |     ..
      
    *terms* must be indices of the table. If present, 'common' column
    will be ignored.
    
    Params
    ------
    
    data      A <pandas.DataFrame object>, or a filename. If a filename is
              given, this will try to load the table as if it were produced
              by tableize_aggregated() and saved with pandas.DataFrame.to_csv()
              as a .csv file, with ',' as separator.
              
    sort_values   A <str> or <list> of <str>. Sorts the table accordingly. Please
              *also* set col_cluster=False (see below, seaborn.clustermap() 
              additional parameters), otherwise columns will still be clustered.              
    
    log_transform   If True, values will be log-transformed. Defaults to True.
              note: values are turned into -log values, thus p-value of 0.05
              gets transformed into 1.3 (with default parameters), as
              10^-1.3 ~ 0.05
    
    log_base  If log_transform, this base will be used as the logarithm base.
              Defaults to 10
    
    log_na    When unable to compute the logarithm, this value will be used
              instead. Defaults to 0 (10^0 == 1)
    
    pval_min  Trims values to the ones matching *at least* this p value. If
              log_transform with default values, this needs to be set accordingly
              For example, if at least p=0.01 is desired, then aim for 
              pval_min=2 (10^-2 == 0.01)
              
    custom_cols   It is possible to pass a <list> of <str> to draw only specified 
              columns of input table
    
    custom_index  It is possible to pass a <list> of <str> to draw only specified
              rows of input table
    
    unwanted_terms   If a <list> of <str> is supplied, 
              
    readable  If set to False (default), the generated heatmap will be of reasonable
              size, possibly not showing all term descriptors. Setting readable=True
              will result into a heatmap where all descriptors are visible (this might
              result into a very tall heatmap)
              
    savefig   If True, a picture of the heatmap will be saved in the current directory.
    
    outfile_name  The file name of the picture saved.
    
    dpi       dpi resolution of saverd picture. Defaults to 300.
    
    **kwargs    The drawing is performed by seaborn.clustermap(). All additional
              keyword arguments are passed directly to it, so that the final picture
              can be precisely tuned. More at:
              https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html
